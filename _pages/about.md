I will join AML Lab in 2023 Fall as a first-year Ph.D student from the School of Data Science at City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof.Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/). Before that, I got M.S. and BS degree from Northwestern Polytechnical university in 2023 and 2020. 

My research interests focus on recommendation system and graph neural networks.

For more information, please feel free to contact me.
